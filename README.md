# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project allows users to draw in a canvas, and categorize the drawings into the 10 digits, from 0 to 9.

This web application uses HTML, JavaScript and CSS for the UI design and behavior.

It also utilizes the TensorFlow library to handle the model and predictions.

Furthermore, the Tensorflow.js package is required to convert the 'digits_model.h5' model file into 'digits_model.json'.
