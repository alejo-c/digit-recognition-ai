# Digit Recognizer AI

This project allows users to draw in a canvas, and categorize the drawings into the 10 digits, from 0 to 9.

The neural network model was trained with the mnist dataset from keras, using training and test data. TensorFlow library is utilized to handle the model and predictions. Furthermore, the Tensorflow.js package is required to convert the 'digits_model.h5' model file into 'digits_model.json'.
